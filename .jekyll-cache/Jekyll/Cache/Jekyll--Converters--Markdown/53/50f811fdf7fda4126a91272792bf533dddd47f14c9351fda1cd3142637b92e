I"²<p>Hi, my name is Rafael Wei, I am a computer engineering student. I decided to create this blog because I believe that writing things with my own words is the best way to understand something. Also I like Iâ€™m currently at Texas Tech doing an exchange program, so I am learning a lot and I have plenty of time to write things that I am learning Iâ€™d like to tell a little bit about my story. I joined one of Brazilâ€™s top colleges in 2017 but got really disappointed. I was one of the best students in high school but still felt way behind my classmates. I believe pre-university education must improve a lot.</p>

<p>I regret a lot not have spent more time in math and programming olympiads. The first one I did win some medals but the latter I didnâ€™t even know that existed. Nowadays I love both, so I would like to share the knowledge I get with other people and hope that it can help whoever wants to know a little bit more about those subjects.</p>

<p>If you ever find some mistakes or if there is some nice idea you want to share, or even if you wanna just talk to someone, please donâ€™t be afraid of sending me an email at rafaelwei07@gmail.com :) I am also gonna store some memes and facts about countries that I eventualy visit and post some things aobut soccer(these are in portuguese). I want to improve my english too, so what could be better than writing my own personal website? Eventually I will try to do some posts in chinese ;)</p>
