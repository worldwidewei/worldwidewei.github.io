Hi, my name is Rafael Wei, I am a computer engineering student. I decided to create this blog because I believe that writing things with my own words is the best way to understand something. Also I like I'm currently at Texas Tech doing an exchange program, so I am learning a lot and I have plenty of time to write things that I am learning I'd like to tell a little bit about my story. I joined one of Brazil's top colleges in 2017 but got really disappointed. I was one of the best students in high school but still felt way behind my classmates. I believe pre-university education must improve a lot. 

I regret a lot not have spent more time in math and programming olympiads. The first one I did win some medals but the latter I didn't even know that existed. Nowadays I love both, so I would like to share the knowledge I get with other people and hope that it can help whoever wants to know a little bit more about those subjects. 

If you ever find some mistakes or if there is some nice idea you want to share, or even if you wanna just talk to someone, please don't be afraid of sending me an email at rafaelwei07@gmail.com :) I am also gonna store some memes and facts about countries that I eventualy visit and post some things aobut soccer(these are in portuguese). I want to improve my english too, so what could be better than writing my own personal website? Eventually I will try to do some posts in chinese ;)
